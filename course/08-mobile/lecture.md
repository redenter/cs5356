[Ash Furrow](/people/ash-furrow.md) of [Artsy](https://artsy.net) will discuss the use of functional reactive programming on iOS. Topics include the motivation behind FRP, its history on other platforms, and its use on iOS in Objective-C and Swift. There will also be coding examples given, starting with simple demos and moving up to more complex behaviour.
