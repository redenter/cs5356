5Status - A job tracker
-----------------------

### Background

Productivity apps have taken over the market and changed lives to make people achieve more and do more with their time. There is always room in improvements that can be made and introduce new workflows.

### Challenge

Productivity app like Asana, Trello put the productivity in the 'team context' while to-do lists like Any.do put it in 'personal context'. We are building a productivity app which finds a middle ground and address the problem that teams change frequently for different to-dos.

For example - You working on building a startup is being handled by trello board. You involved in different things like plumbing work, painting, shopping (with wife), a 10-day classroom project involves multiple small teams - you and plumber, you and wife, you and 2 other classmates.

We're preaching a workflow which restricts us from creating multiple job boards for multiple small jobs consisting multiple teams.
