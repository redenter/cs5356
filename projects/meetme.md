MeetMe
--------------------

### Background:

Automating the process of scheduling and keeping track of meetings has been around for a long time, especially in professional environments. Typically, organizations make use of products such as Outlook or Google Calendar to achieve this. However, these either require all users to be on a certain app/network, or require users to share contacts/details with each other, which is troublesome, especially for one-off meetings. They are also not tailored for individuals.

MeetMe is an app that syncs with all your calendars to seamlessly schedule meetings, whether a professional one or for drinks with friends.

### Challenge:
The app will sync with your calendars and allow you to create “meeting groups” with your friends/colleagues and to suggest preferred meeting times. Once all parties accept the invitation to join the group, the app would automatically calculate and return all eligible meeting timeslots. Once the group votes and agrees on a preferred timeslot, the meeting time is then synced back to the users’ calendars and a meeting time is set!
