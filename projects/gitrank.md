This is an already started project that is intended to be used for this course.

### Background
When you are a Developer building something you are often looking for libraries to make you life easier. However, it turns out there are many choices of libraries that does the same thing, How do you choose ? The usual process is to look at the library, the documentation, reviews on the web, and maybe, to be thorough try several. This takes time and we can change that.

### Challenge
There are some services that are emerging around this market like [StackShare](http://stackshare.io/), [OpenHub](https://www.openhub.net/),
[Libraries.io](https://libraries.io/),
[githubRanking.com](githubranking.com), [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/) ... Let's make something in between those, more innovative and easier to use.
