Drive Thru Home
------------------------------------

### Background

An online service that enables you to quickly make choices to furnish a particular room or an entire apartment.

### Challenge

The challenge would be to build a site that will be quick and responsive to user choices and will encompass an entire user experience from product choice to checkout. 

### Team

[Rishav Kanoria](/people/rishav-kanoria.md)

### Project Management

I am using [Waffle](https://waffle.io/rishky/DriveThruHome) for my project management tool.

### First Story

Our first story is: a user would visit the website, choose which room he would like to furnish, pick from one of the available options given to the user and then the system would compile all the corresponding items according to the user's single choice.

### Version Control

My code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/rishky/DriveThruHome).
